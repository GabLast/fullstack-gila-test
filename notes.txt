Notification Test Notes

General Design 

- Receives Messages: Has Category and Body
- Messages have to be forwarded to users (can be generated on bootstrap)
- Users can be subscribed to message categories
- Users can choose channels to be notified: SMS, Email or Push Notification
** Users can only receive notifications through the channels they want and
	from the categories they're subscribed to.

- 3 Bootstrap categories: Sports - Finance - Movies
- 3 Bootstrap notifications: SMS - E-mail - Push Notification
- No 3rd party management. Make logic from scratch
- Store relevant information to verify that the notification has been delivered:
  Message Type | Notification Type | User data | timestamp | anything else
  
UI

- Message Form
- Log history: A list of all data records in the log, sorted from newest to oldest.
